This local carries the steps for wiring Keystone UI into a host app. Follow them
in order, exactly as written, and invent none.

## What Keystone UI is

A Rails engine gem that supplies an app's visual layer as `ui_*` view helpers
built on ViewComponent; hook it in before building any screen with those helpers.

## Interface

- `bin/rails generate keystone:install` — sets up the host's Tailwind entry
  point, registers the gem's Stimulus controllers, and adds the theme attributes
  to the layout's `<html>` tag. Safe to re-run.
- `KeystoneUi.configure` — a block yielding the configuration: `accent` and
  `surface` (palette names, `:blue` and `:zinc` unless set),
  `theme_mode_supplier` (a callable that supplies a light, dark, system or
  custom mode),
  `register_look` (a look's CSS file by name), `default_look` and
  `look_supplier` (which registered look a page gets),
  `trail_supplier` (a callable that supplies the breadcrumb trail for form and
  show pages that pass none, and their Back link when they pass none either),
  `preference_supplier` (a callable that supplies the saved hidden columns and
  column order of a data table given a `key:`, and the address its Columns menu
  saves to, and the navigation's placement under the key `:navigation`),
  `navigation_group` (a labelled group of desktop tabs that `ui_navigation`
  draws, each tab declared with `tab key, label:, href:, permitted:`),
  `current_tab_supplier` (a callable that supplies the key of the declared tab
  the current page belongs to, so `ui_navigation` marks it and its group
  active),
  and the `tailwind_imports` and `tailwind_sources` lists (extra CSS files and
  scan paths added to the Tailwind build).
- `keystone_theme_attributes` — a layout helper placed inside the `<html>` tag.
  It writes `data-theme="light"`, `data-theme="dark"` or `data-theme="custom"`
  for the page's mode, and writes nothing for system so the page follows the
  operating system. The mode is the `keystone_theme` cookie's choice, then the
  configured `theme_mode_supplier`, then light. It also writes
  `data-look="<name>"` for the page's look: the `look_supplier`'s name, then
  `default_look`, each used only when registered. With no look registered it
  writes no `data-look`.

## How to use it

1. Confirm the prerequisites: Ruby >= 3.2 and **tailwindcss-rails v4+** in the
   host app. The gem brings ViewComponent and keystone_ui-styles 0.12.0 or later with it.
   Tailwind does not have to be initialized first, because the generator creates
   the stylesheet if it is missing.

2. Add the gem to the Gemfile and install it:

   ```ruby
   gem "keystone_ui"
   ```

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

   If the project sources its own gems from somewhere other than RubyGems (a git
   or path reference), ask the developer which to use rather than choosing.

3. Run the generator:

   ```bash
   bin/rails generate keystone:install
   ```

   It touches three host files:

   - `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` — if absent, it is created holding
     `@import "tailwindcss";` and `@import "./keystone_source.css";`. If present,
     the Keystone import is added on the line after `@import "tailwindcss";`, and
     Keystone lines left by older installs are removed.
   - `app/javascript/controllers/index.js` — appends
     `import { registerControllers } from "keystone_ui/index"` and
     `registerControllers(application)`.
   - `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` — adds
     `<%= keystone_theme_attributes %>` directly after the first `<html` in the
     file, so the tag reads `<html <%= keystone_theme_attributes %> ...>`. A
     layout that already contains the call is left unchanged.

   Read its output for two warnings:

   - `app/javascript/controllers/index.js not found` — ask the developer where
     the Stimulus application is set up and add those two lines there. Without
     them, dropdowns, modals, file uploads, the column picker, the theme toggle,
     the info button's popups and the other interactive components do nothing.
     `registerControllers(application)` also copies `data-theme` and `data-look`
     from each page Turbo renders onto the `<html>` tag. Without it, a Turbo
     visit keeps the theme and look of the first page loaded.
   - `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb not found` — ask the developer which
     layout the app renders and add `<%= keystone_theme_attributes %>` to its
     `<html>` tag. Without it, a saved light or dark choice is not applied when
     the page loads.

   The CSS step only adds the Keystone import if `application.css` contains the
   exact line `@import "tailwindcss";` followed by a line break. If the output
   says nothing about the import and the line is not in the file, add
   `@import "./keystone_source.css";` directly under the Tailwind import by hand.

4. Restart the app (or rebuild assets). On boot the engine writes
   `app/assets/tailwind/keystone_source.css`, which imports the gem's theme and
   component CSS and points Tailwind at the component files. It is written only
   when `application.css` exists **and** contains
   `@import "./keystone_source.css";`, so if the file never appears, that import
   is missing.

5. Keep the generated file out of git. It holds absolute paths to the gem on the
   machine that booted the app, and is rewritten on every boot, which includes
   the dev server, CI and `assets:precompile`. Add to `.gitignore`:

   ```
   app/assets/tailwind/keystone_source.css
   ```

   Only the `@import` line in `application.css` belongs in the repo.

6. Settle the palette. Without configuration the accent scale is blue and the
   surface scale is zinc. To change them statically, add an `@theme` block to
   `application.css` **after** the two imports and override only the shades the
   app uses:

   ```css
   @import "tailwindcss";
   @import "./keystone_source.css";

   @theme {
     --color-accent-500: #6366f1;
     --color-accent-600: #4f46e5;
   }
   ```

   Both scales run 50 through 950. Every component picks the values up with no
   component changes.

   This is a decision to put to the developer: fixed app-wide colors set in CSS,
   or per-user colors generated at runtime by a companion theming gem. Ask which
   the app wants before wiring either.

   To change how components look beyond the palette, write a look file: one CSS
   file holding a `:root` rule, outside any `@layer` block, that sets the
   `--ks-` variables from keystone_ui-styles for corner radius, font, label
   weight, border width, padding and colours. Set each colour's `-dark`
   partner too, or dark pages keep the default colour. Import it after
   Keystone:

   ```css
   @import "tailwindcss";
   @import "./keystone_source.css";
   @import "./look.css";
   ```

   Buttons, panels, cards, alerts, badges, form fields, the modal, the mobile
   action menu, the action menu, the column picker, multi select, copy button, theme toggle,
   checkbox row, radio card, option card, file upload and colour picker read
   these variables. So do the data display components: stat card, chart card,
   card link, CTA banner, feature grid, hero, data table, code, accordion,
   disclosure, calculation, info button, breakdown, figure, tab switcher, progress,
   funnel, bucket, pipeline and swipe deck.
   So do the navigation components: navbar, nav item, nav dropdown, bottom nav,
   mobile header and settings link. The desktop "Back" link and the breadcrumbs
   on form and show pages use the mobile header's back link variables. The
   keystone_ui-styles README lists every variable and its default.

   To offer several looks and choose one per page, register them by name in
   step 7 rather than importing them here.

7. Write `config/initializers/keystone_ui.rb` only if one of the settings below
   is wanted. Ask the developer about each rather than adding any by default.
   The engine reads the configuration after initializers have run, so this file
   is where the block goes.

   ```ruby
   require "keystone_ui"

   KeystoneUi.configure do |config|
     config.accent = :emerald
     config.surface = :slate
     config.theme_mode_supplier = ->(view) { view.current_user&.theme }
     config.register_look :compact, "/absolute/path/to/compact.css"
     config.default_look = :compact
     config.look_supplier = ->(view) { view.current_user&.look }
     config.trail_supplier = ->(view) { view.breadcrumb_trail }
     config.preference_supplier = ->(view, key) { TablePreferences.for(view.current_user, key) }
     config.navigation_group "Sales" do |group|
       group.tab :quotes, label: "Quotes", href: ->(view) { view.quotes_path }, permitted: ->(view) { view.policy(Quote).index? }
     end
     config.current_tab_supplier = ->(view) { view.controller.try(:navigation_tab) }
     config.tailwind_imports << "/absolute/path/to/extra.css"
     config.tailwind_sources << "/absolute/path/to/components/**/*.{erb,rb}"
   end
   ```

   - `accent` and `surface` — set these only when a companion gem or engine
     reads the palette choice. Keystone UI stores the names and changes no color
     from them, because colors come from the CSS custom properties in step 6.
   - `theme_mode_supplier` — a callable that receives the view and returns
     `"light"`, `"dark"`, `"system"`, `"custom"` or `nil`. It supplies the mode
     when the user has not picked one with the theme toggle, since the
     `keystone_theme` cookie that the toggle writes takes precedence. Any other
     return value, or no supplier, falls back to light.
   - A supplied `"custom"` marks the layout's `<html>` tag
     `data-theme="custom"`. The theme toggle does not offer custom, so only a
     supplier sets it. Ask the developer which gem or code supplies custom and
     its colors before returning it.
   - `register_look :name, path` — registers a look file by name and appends it
     to `tailwind_imports`, so `keystone_source.css` imports it. A look offered
     this way scopes its variables to `:root[data-look="<name>"]` instead of
     `:root`, so several can be imported at once.
   - `default_look = :name` — the look a page gets when nothing else chooses one.
   - The app refuses to boot when `default_look` names a look that is not
     registered, when a registered look's file does not exist, or when the file
     sets no `--ks-` variable inside a `:root[data-look="<name>"]` rule. Use an
     absolute path for each look file.
   - `look_supplier` — a callable that receives the view and returns a look
     name for the request. A name that is not registered, or `nil`, leaves the
     page on the default look.
   - `trail_supplier` — a callable that receives the view and returns the
     breadcrumb trail as an array of `[label, href]` pairs, an empty array, or
     `nil`. It is asked only by a form or show page that passes no `trail:`.
     A page that passes its own trail, including an empty one, keeps it.
   - On `lg:` screens a form or show page shows a "Back" link, and under it the
     breadcrumbs ending with the page's title when the trail has any links. A
     page that passes no `back_url:` goes back to the trail's last link. With
     no supplier, or a `nil` return, the page shows only its Back link.
   - An empty trail marks a nav tab's own page, which has nowhere to go back
     to. The page shows no Back link and no breadcrumbs, and raises nothing.
     Return `[]` from the supplier for those
     pages, and `nil` for a page whose Back link comes from its own
     `back_url:`.
   - Every other form and show page must end up with a Back link. A page that
     passes no `back_url:`, and has no trail or a trail whose last link has no
     address, raises `KeystoneUi::MissingBackLink` naming the page's title when
     it renders. The message tells the developer to pass `back_url:` or
     `trail:`, to supply a trail through `trail_supplier`, or to pass
     `trail: []` on a nav tab's own page.
   - Every link in a trail needs both a label and an address. A trail with a
     blank label or address raises `KeystoneUi::IncompleteTrail` naming the
     page's title.
   - Ask the developer which code in the app knows each page's trail, and which
     pages are nav tabs' own pages, before writing the callable. If some form
     or show pages pass no `back_url:`, ask where their Back link should come
     from before enabling the supplier or leaving it out.
   - `preference_supplier` — a callable that receives the view and a data
     table's key and returns `{ value:, save_url: }`, or `nil` when the person
     can neither see nor save a layout for that key. It is asked only for
     tables rendered with a `key:`. A table with no `key:`, a supplier returning
     `nil`, or no supplier at all renders with the hidden columns its own call
     passes and shows no Columns menu.
   - `value` holds the hidden column names under the string key
     `"hidden_columns"`, such as `{ "hidden_columns" => ["sku"] }`. That list
     replaces the hidden columns the table's own call passes, and an empty list
     shows every column. Only columns marked hideable are hidden.
   - A column marked locked is never hideable, even when it is also marked
     hideable. A saved layout cannot hide it or move it, and the Columns menu
     does not list it.
   - When `value` is `nil`, or has no `"hidden_columns"` string key, the table
     keeps the hidden columns its own call passes. A symbol key is not read, so
     `{ hidden_columns: [...] }` also keeps them.
   - `value` may also hold a list of hideable column names under the string
     key `"column_order"`, such as
     `{ "hidden_columns" => ["sku"], "column_order" => ["price", "sku"] }`.
     The table renders its hideable columns in that order, in the places
     hideable columns hold in its own call, then any hideable columns the list
     leaves out in the order they were declared. Columns that are not hideable
     keep their place, and names that match no hideable column are ignored.
     With no `"column_order"` string key the columns keep their declared order.
   - When nothing is saved yet for a person who may save a layout, return
     `{ value: nil, save_url: }`. The table then shows its own default layout
     with the Columns menu, so the person can save a first layout.
   - When `save_url` is present, the table shows a Columns button above its
     right edge. The button opens a menu listing the hideable columns in the
     order the table shows them, with the currently hidden columns unchecked,
     and gives each column an up and a down button.
   - Ticking, unticking and moving columns change only the menu while it is
     open. When the menu is closed, by its Columns button or by a click
     outside it, it sends one `PATCH` to `save_url` if anything was changed
     while it was open, then reloads the page. A menu closed with no change
     sends nothing.
   - The `PATCH` carries the page's CSRF token and the JSON body
     `{"hidden_columns": [...], "column_order": [...]}`. `column_order` lists
     every hideable column's name in the menu's order.
   - The host must have a route and action at `save_url` that store both lists
     for that key. The supplier must return them in `value` under the same
     string keys, `"hidden_columns"` and `"column_order"`, or the saved order
     is not applied. With no `save_url`, the saved layout applies and no menu
     is shown.
   - The action at `save_url` must answer a stored layout with a 2xx status.
     Any other status, or a request that cannot reach the server, leaves the
     page unreloaded. The table then shows "Your column changes were not
     saved." beside its Columns button, and the menu's boxes and order go back
     to what the table shows.
   - For the key `:navigation` the supplier returns the person's navigation
     placement as `{ value: { "placement" => "left" } }`, with `"left"`,
     `"right"` or `"top"`. `ui_navigation` draws a sidebar on the left or the
     right of the page content on desktop screens for the first two, and the
     top bar for `"top"`, `nil`, a value with no `"placement"` string key, or
     any other placement.
   - The same `:navigation` value may hold the person's order of groups and
     tabs under `"order"`, as
     `[ { "group" => "Admin" }, { "group" => "Sales", "tabs" => [ "orders", "quotes" ] } ]`.
     A group is named by its declared label and a tab by its key as a string.
     `ui_navigation` draws the named groups and tabs first in that order, then
     the rest in declared order, and ignores names no longer declared.
   - A companion preferences gem may set this supplier for the app. Ask the
     developer whether the app uses one, or which code stores each user's table
     layouts, before writing the callable.
   - `navigation_group "Label" do |group| ... end` — declares one menu of
     desktop tabs, in the order the groups are declared. Inside the block,
     `group.tab key, label:, href:, permitted:` adds a tab in order. `href:` is
     an address or a callable that receives the view and returns one.
     `permitted:` is a callable that receives the view and returns whether the
     current person may see the tab. The layout renders them with
     `ui_navigation` around `yield`, setting the app's logo with
     `navigation.with_logo` and its account and user menus with
     `navigation.with_menus` inside the block, so the layout draws no other
     top bar. Ask the developer which tabs and groups the app has, and which
     permission check guards each, before declaring them.
   - `current_tab_supplier` — a callable that receives the view and returns the
     key of the declared tab the current page belongs to, or `nil`.
     `ui_navigation` shows that tab and its group as active in the top bar and
     gives that tab and its group's label the `active` class in the sidebar.
     `nil`, a key no declared tab has, or no supplier marks nothing. The
     callable must answer for every page the layout draws, so a page with no
     tab returns `nil` rather than raising. Ask the developer how a page names
     its tab, such as a method on each controller, before writing the callable.
   - `tailwind_imports` and `tailwind_sources` — lists to append to, never
     assign. Each import becomes an `@import` line and each source becomes an
     `@source` line in `keystone_source.css` on the next boot. They are for
     another gem or engine whose CSS or templates must be in the same Tailwind
     build, and that gem normally appends its own entries. A gem that ships a
     look appends its look file to `tailwind_imports` from its own initializer,
     and `keystone_source.css` imports it after keystone_ui-styles.

## Conventions

- **Verify the install before building anything on it.** Check four things:
  `application.css` holds both imports, `app/assets/tailwind/keystone_source.css`
  exists after a boot, the Stimulus setup calls `registerControllers(application)`,
  and the layout's `<html>` tag contains `<%= keystone_theme_attributes %>`. Then
  load one page that renders a `ui_*` helper and confirm it is styled and that an
  interactive component (a dropdown, a dismissible alert, an info button)
  responds.
- **Importmap is the supported JS path.** For apps configured with importmap the
  gem pins its own controllers, and the charting library they need, on boot, so
  the host pins nothing. If the app bundles JavaScript instead (esbuild, bun,
  webpack), the appended `keystone_ui/index` import has nothing pinned behind
  it. Tell the developer rather than guessing at a bundler configuration.
- **Re-run the generator after upgrading the gem.** It removes superseded install
  lines and reports that each file is already up to date when there is nothing
  to do.
- **New components need no re-run.** Tailwind rescans the gem on each build, so
  components added by a later version are styled on the next boot.
- On boot the engine deletes `app/assets/builds/tailwind/keystone_ui_engine.css`
  if an older install left it there. Do not recreate it.
- Building UI with the helpers, including which helper to use and what keywords
  it takes, is out of scope here and belongs to `keystone_ui-develop`.

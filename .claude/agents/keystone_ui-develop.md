name: keystone_ui-develop
description: Use PROACTIVELY for building or editing screens in a Rails app that has Keystone UI — pages, forms, tables, navigation, action menus for a record's Edit and Delete, dashboards, charts, amounts shown in green or red as a gain or loss, marketing sections, a light/dark theme switch — MUST BE USED instead of hand-writing ERB and Tailwind for UI.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep
scope: UI — pages, forms, tables, navigation, dashboards
---

This local builds screens by composing Keystone UI's `ui_*` view helpers in ERB.
It always works the same way: pick the page shell, fill it with the helpers that
match the content, and write no Tailwind classes of its own.

## What Keystone UI is

Keystone UI is a Rails engine that supplies an app's visual layer as a library of
view helpers. Each helper renders one named piece — a page shell, a section, a
form field, a data table, a navigation bar, a stat card, a chart — with all
styling and dark-mode treatment owned inside the gem. Two screens built from the
same helpers cannot drift apart, and a change to a piece updates every screen at
once. It is mobile-first: several helpers ship distinct mobile and desktop
treatments, which matters because these apps are often viewed in a native
webview.

Fire on any request to build or change a screen, view, form, table, navigation,
or dashboard in an app that has Keystone UI installed. If the `ui_*` helpers are
not available in the app yet, that is the `keystone_ui-install` local's job, not
this one's.

## Interface

Every entry point is a view helper called from ERB. Keywords with defaults are
optional; the rest are required. Symbol options are validated — an unrecognized
one raises at render time. Two exceptions: `ui_page`'s `padding:` treats any
value other than `:none` as `:standard`, and `ui_pipeline`'s box `accent:` falls
back to `:muted`.

Six helpers — `ui_page`, `ui_section`, `ui_page_header`, `ui_card`, `ui_alert`,
`ui_badge` — also accept `class:`, a string of classes appended to the helper's
outer element. See Conventions before using it.

### Page shells and layout

- `ui_page(max_width: :full, padding: :standard, top_offset: nil, class: nil)` —
  takes a block. The outer wrapper for a screen. `max_width:` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`
  `:xl` `:full`; `padding:` `:standard` or `:none`; `top_offset:` `:sm` `:md`
  `:lg` `:xl` to clear a fixed navbar. When `ui_form_page` or `ui_show_page` was
  called earlier on the same screen, `ui_page` renders their "Back" link, their
  breadcrumbs, and the form page's title, in that order, at its top, above the
  block.
- `ui_section(title: nil, subtitle: nil, action: nil, menu: [], spacing: :md, class: nil)`
  — takes a block. A titled block of content with an optional right-aligned
  link. `action:` is `{ label:, href: }`; `spacing:` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`.
  `menu:` is `[{ label:, href:, method: }, ...]`, each hash taking the keywords
  of `ui_action_menu_item`, and renders an action menu at the right of the
  header. The header, and with it `action:` and `menu:`, renders only when
  `title:` is given.
- `ui_panel(padding: :md, radius: :lg, shadow: true)` — takes a block. A bordered
  card surface. `padding:` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`; `radius:` `:md` `:lg` `:xl`.
- `ui_grid(cols: { default: 1 }, gap: :md, gap_x: nil, gap_y: nil)` — takes a
  block. A responsive grid. `cols:` maps breakpoints `:default` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`
  to a column count 1–12, e.g. `{ default: 1, md: 3 }`. `gap:` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`
  `:xl`; passing `gap_x:`/`gap_y:` replaces `gap:` entirely.
- `ui_card_link(href:, padding: :md, shadow: true)` — takes a block. A whole
  panel that is one link. `padding:` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`.
- `ui_card(title:, summary:, link:, cta: "Read more", edge_to_edge: false, class: nil)`
  — a fixed title/summary/CTA card. `edge_to_edge: true` drops the side border and
  corner rounding below `sm:` so it spans the full width on mobile.
- `ui_page_header(title:, subtitle: nil, action_url: nil, action_label: "Add new", class: nil)`
  — takes a block yielding the header. Desktop-only page title (hidden below
  `sm:`). Call `header.action { ... }` in the block to place a custom control on
  the right; only what `action` receives is rendered. Passing `action_url:`
  publishes that URL and label for a mobile navbar to pick up.
- `ui_form_page(title:, back_url: nil, subtitle: nil, trail: nil)` — the shell
  marker for a form screen. It renders nothing where it is called. It publishes
  the title and back URL so the navbar can render mobile header context, and
  hands `ui_page` a "Back" link to `back_url` shown from `lg:` up, then the
  title and subtitle shown from `md:` up. Call it before `ui_page`, outside
  `ui_page`'s block, or none of that appears. Passing a non-empty `trail:` adds
  breadcrumbs under the "Back" link: the trail's links followed by `title`
  unlinked, as `ui_breadcrumbs` renders them, shown from `lg:` up. With no
  `trail:`, it uses the trail the app supplies for the current request, if the
  app supplies one. With no `back_url:`, the back URL is the `href` of the
  trail's last link. A `trail:` or `back_url:` passed here always wins over the
  supplied ones. `trail: []` marks the page a navigation tab opens directly: it
  shows no "Back" link and no breadcrumbs, publishes no back URL when no
  `back_url:` is passed, so the mobile header shows no back arrow, and raises
  nothing. With no `back_url:` and no trail from either place, or a trail whose
  last link has no `href`, rendering raises `KeystoneUi::MissingBackLink`,
  naming the page's title. A trail with any link whose label or `href` is `nil`
  or blank raises `KeystoneUi::IncompleteTrail`, naming the page's title, even
  when `back_url:` is passed.
- `ui_show_page(title:, back_url: nil, subtitle: nil, trail: nil)` — the shell
  marker for a detail screen. It renders nothing where it is called. It
  publishes the title, subtitle, and back URL for the navbar, and hands
  `ui_page` a "Back" link to `back_url` shown from `lg:` up. Call it before
  `ui_page`, outside `ui_page`'s block. It shows no title, so put
  `ui_page_header` inside the `ui_page` block for the desktop title. `trail:`
  and `back_url:` work as they do on `ui_form_page`, including the breadcrumbs
  under the "Back" link, the supplied trail, the fallback to the trail's last
  link, `trail: []` for a navigation tab's own page, and the
  `KeystoneUi::MissingBackLink` and `KeystoneUi::IncompleteTrail` errors, and
  the breadcrumbs end with `title` unlinked.
- `ui_breadcrumbs(trail:, current: nil)` — a line of links shown only from `lg:`
  up. `trail:` is `[[label, href], ...]`, from the top level down, and each pair
  renders as a link, separated by `›`. `current:` is the page being shown,
  rendered last, unlinked, and marked as the current page. On a form or detail
  screen pass `trail:` to the shell instead of calling this helper.

### Navigation

- `ui_navbar(sticky: true)` — takes a block yielding the navbar. Fill named slots
  on it: `logo`, `desktop_links`, `desktop_right`, `mobile_left`,
  `mobile_center`, `mobile_right`. Desktop slots are hidden below `lg:` and the
  mobile slots above it. `desktop_right` renders only when `desktop_links` is
  also filled.
- `ui_navigation` — no keywords, takes a block holding the page content. Placed
  in the layout around `yield`, it draws the tabs the app declares with
  `config.navigation_group` as a top bar of menus from `lg:` up, then the
  content. It leaves out tabs whose permission check fails and groups with no
  tab left, and below `lg:` it draws only the content. Inside the block, a
  `navigation.with_logo do ... end` block puts the app's logo at the left end
  of the top bar, and a `navigation.with_menus do ... end` block puts menus
  such as the account menu and the user menu at its right end, so the layout
  draws no second bar for them. When the preference supplied for
  `:navigation` holds `{ "placement" => "left" }` or `"right"`, it draws a
  sidebar on that side of the content from `lg:` up instead, with each group's
  label above its tabs, the logo at its top and the menus at its bottom, and
  below `lg:` the content takes the full width. Any other placement draws the
  top bar. When that value holds an `"order"` list of
  `{ "group" => label, "tabs" => [tab key strings] }` entries, both placements
  draw the named groups and tabs first in that order, then the rest in
  declared order, ignoring names no longer declared. When the app sets `config.current_tab_supplier`, the tab whose key
  it returns for the page and that tab's group are shown as active in either
  placement, and nothing is marked when it returns `nil`, a key no declared
  tab has, or is not set. Check whether the app's Keystone UI
  initializer declares navigation groups before adding desktop tabs by hand;
  declaring them is `keystone_ui-install`'s job.
- `ui_nav_item(label:, href:, active: false)` — one desktop navigation link.
- `ui_nav_dropdown(title:, area:, active: false)` — takes a block. A navbar
  dropdown; the block holds the menu links.
- `ui_bottom_nav` — no keywords, takes a block. The mobile bottom tab bar; hidden
  above `lg:` and inside a Hotwire Native webview.
- `ui_bottom_nav_item(label:, href:, icon:, active: false)` — one bottom tab.
  `icon:` is a raw SVG string.
- `ui_mobile_header(title:, back_url:, subtitle: nil)` — a back chevron plus
  centered title for mobile; hidden above `lg:`. Place it in the navbar's
  `mobile_left` slot. `back_url:` must be passed, and `nil` renders the title
  with no back chevron.
- `ui_action_menu` — no keywords, takes a block. An ellipsis (⋯) button that
  opens a dropdown of actions, shown at every screen size. Fill the block with
  `ui_action_menu_item` calls.
- `ui_action_menu_item(label:, href:, method: :get, confirm: nil)` — one entry
  in an action menu. With `method: :get` it is a link to `href`. Any other
  method, such as `:post`, `:patch` or `:delete`, renders a button inside its
  own small form that sends that method to `href`, so never place such an item
  inside a `ui_form` block, since a form cannot contain another form.
  `confirm:` is a question Turbo asks before the item sends. With no
  `confirm:`, a `method: :delete` item asks "<label> this? This cannot be
  undone.", and every other method sends without asking. A `method: :get` item
  is a plain link and ignores `confirm:`.
- `ui_mobile_actions` — no keywords, takes a block. An ellipsis dropdown for
  mobile actions; the block holds the menu items. Hidden above `lg:`. Use
  `ui_action_menu` instead when the actions must also be reachable on desktop.
- `ui_settings_link(label:, href:)` — a full-width settings row with a chevron.
- `ui_theme_toggle` — no keywords, no block. A row of three buttons, Light, Dark
  and System, that switches the page's theme at once and remembers the choice in
  the `keystone_theme` cookie for a year. System follows the operating system.
  The button for the page's current mode renders pressed. When the current mode
  is a custom palette supplied by another gem, no button is pressed, because the
  toggle does not offer custom.

### Forms

- `ui_form(action:, method: :post, multipart: false, data: nil)` — takes a block.
  The `<form>` wrapper. `method:` may be `:patch`/`:put`/`:delete` and is
  translated for Rails. Set `multipart: true` when the form contains a file
  upload.
- `ui_form_field(attribute:, label: nil, type: :text, required: false, hint: nil, placeholder: nil, min: nil, max: nil, step: nil, value: nil, options: [], errors: [], include_blank: nil, disabled: false, suggestions: [])`
  — a labeled field with hint and error text. This is the default way to render
  an input. `type:` `:text` `:number` `:email` `:password` `:date` `:textarea`
  `:checkbox` `:select`. `attribute:` is used verbatim as the input's `name`, so
  pass the full param name the controller expects, e.g. `"quote[title]"`, and
  pass `label:` whenever the attribute is a nested name. `label:` defaults to the
  attribute with underscores turned to spaces and the first letter capitalized.
  `options:` is for `:select` and takes `[[label, value], ...]`; `value:` picks
  the selected option, and a non-required select gets a leading empty option,
  worded by `include_blank:` (for example `"Not set yet"`) or left blank without
  it. Never add your own empty choice to `options:` as well. A
  `:checkbox` renders its label beside the box, submits `"0"` when unchecked and
  `"1"` when checked, and pre-checks when `value:` is `"1"`. `errors:` is an
  array of message strings. `suggestions:` is an array of strings the browser
  offers while the field's text is typed, and the user can still type a value
  that is not in it. It applies to `:text`, `:number`, `:email`, `:password`
  and `:date` fields, and a `:textarea`, `:checkbox` or `:select` ignores it.
  The suggestion list's `id` is built from `attribute:`, so two fields with
  suggestions on one screen need different `attribute:` values.
- `ui_input(name:, type: :text, value: nil, placeholder: nil, disabled: false, min: nil, max: nil, step: nil)`
  — a bare styled input with no label. `type:` `:text` `:number` `:email`
  `:password` `:date`.
- `ui_textarea(name:, value: nil, rows: 3, placeholder: nil, disabled: false)` —
  a bare styled textarea.
- `ui_select(name:, options: [], selected: nil, include_blank: nil, disabled: false)`
  — a bare styled select. `options:` is `[[label, value], ...]`;
  `include_blank:` is the text of a leading empty option.
- `ui_multi_select(name:, label:, options:, selected: [])` — a dropdown of
  checkboxes all posting under `name`, used verbatim; pass an array name such as
  `"status[]"` so every checked value arrives. `options:` is
  `[[label, value], ...]`; `selected:` is the values to pre-check. The trigger
  reads "All <label>" when nothing is checked and "N selected" otherwise.
- `ui_file_upload(name:, label: nil, accept: nil, multiple: false, hint: nil)` —
  a drop zone with drag-and-drop and selected-file feedback. Requires the
  enclosing form to be multipart.
- `ui_color_picker(name:, value: "#000000", label: nil)` — a swatch that opens a
  hue/saturation panel and writes the hex into a hidden input named `name`.
- `ui_radio_card(name:, value:, label:, hint: nil, info: nil, checked: false)`
  — a selectable card backed by a real radio input; selection styling is pure
  CSS. `hint:` is a line of text always shown under the label. `info:` is
  longer text about the option, kept hidden: passing it adds an info button on
  the row with the label, named "About <label>" for screen readers, and the
  text shows in a panel floating below the card while the button is hovered,
  and tapping the button toggles it. With no `info:` the card has no info
  button.
- `ui_checkbox_row(name:, value:, label:, hint: nil, info: nil, checked: false)`
  — a real checkbox with its label and optional hint inside one `<label>`, so a
  tap anywhere on the row toggles the box. A checked row submits `value` under
  `name`; give several rows the same array name, e.g. `"shown[]"`, to submit the
  checked values as a list. An unchecked row submits nothing. `hint:` is a line
  of text always shown under the label. `info:` works as it does on
  `ui_radio_card`: passing it adds an info button on the line with the label,
  named "About <label>" for screen readers, and the text shows in a panel
  floating below the row while the button is hovered, and tapping the button
  toggles it. With no `info:` the row has no info button.
- `ui_option_card(name:, value:, selected: false, input_data: {}, label_data: {})`
  — takes a block. A radio whose visible body is whatever the block renders.
  `input_data:`/`label_data:` become `data-*` attributes on the input and label.

### Tables

- `ui_data_table(items:, columns:, empty_message: nil, sort: nil, sort_direction: nil, sort_url: nil, hidden_columns: [], key: nil)`
  — takes a block yielding the table. `items:` are records or hashes; each cell
  value is read by calling the column key on the item, falling back to `item[key]`.
  `columns:` accepts plain `{ key: "Label" }` hashes or `Keystone::Ui::Column`
  objects. In the block, `table.link(:column_key) { |item| url }` turns that
  column's cells into links and `table.actions { |item| ... }` appends a
  right-aligned actions column. With no actions column, the last data
  column's header and cells are both right-aligned, so put the column of
  amounts last to line them up under their header. Each row's actions render inside an action
  menu, so the `actions` block holds `ui_action_menu_item` calls and nothing
  else, never buttons or bare links. Sorting requires all three of `sort:` (the
  current column key), `sort_direction:` (`:asc`/`:desc`), and `sort_url:` (a
  lambda taking `(column_key, direction)` and returning a URL); headers then
  render as links that flip direction. `hidden_columns:` drops columns
  server-side and only affects columns declared `hideable: true`. `key:` (a
  symbol or string) names the table so it looks up a saved layout through the
  app's preference supplier. When the supplier returns a saved value for the
  key that lists `"hidden_columns"`, the hideable columns in that list replace
  the ones passed in `hidden_columns:`, and a saved empty list shows every
  column. When the saved value is `nil` or lists no `"hidden_columns"`, the
  table keeps the columns `hidden_columns:` hides. When the saved value lists
  `"column_order"`, an array of column keys, the hideable columns render in
  that order, followed by any hideable columns the list leaves out in the order
  they were declared. Columns that are not hideable keep their declared place,
  and the hideable ones fill the remaining places. With no `"column_order"` the
  columns keep their declared order. Whenever the supplier
  returns a save address, the table renders a "Columns" menu in a row above
  itself, aligned right, that saves to it as `ui_column_picker` does and shows
  the same message when a save fails, including for a person with nothing saved
  yet. That menu lists the hideable columns in
  the order the table shows them and leaves ticked exactly the ones the table
  shows. When the
  supplier returns nothing, when no supplier is set, or when no `key:` is
  passed, the table renders from `hidden_columns:` with no Columns menu. In
  every case `hidden_columns:` is the table's default layout.
- `Keystone::Ui::Column.new(key, header_text, mobile_hidden: false, sortable: false, hideable: false, locked: false)`
  — a column with per-column options, for when a `{ key: "Label" }` hash is not
  enough. `mobile_hidden:` hides the column below `sm:`; `sortable:` opts it into
  sort headers; `hideable:` lets the Columns menu hide it and move it, and a
  saved `"column_order"` place it. `locked: true` on the table's first column
  keeps its header and cells in view while the rest of the table scrolls
  sideways. A locked column that is not first renders as an ordinary column. A
  locked column is never hideable, even with `hideable: true`: it is left out of
  the Columns menu, `hidden_columns:` and a saved layout cannot hide it, and a
  saved `"column_order"` cannot move it.
- `ui_column_picker(columns:, hidden_columns: [], save_url: nil)` — a "Columns"
  dropdown with one row per `hideable` column, in the order `columns:` lists
  them. Each row has a checkbox and an up and a down button that move the
  column one place; the first row's up button and the last row's down button
  are disabled, and after a move the disabled buttons follow the new first and
  last rows. A hidden column's name renders greyed, and unticking a box greys
  its name at once. Pass it the same columns, in the order the table shows
  them, and the same hidden keys as the table. Ticking, unticking and moving
  change only the open menu and send nothing. When the menu closes, by its
  Columns button or by a click outside it, it sends one `PATCH save_url` with
  JSON `{ "hidden_columns": ["key", ...], "column_order": ["key", ...] }` and a
  `X-CSRF-Token` header, then reloads the page. A menu closed with nothing
  changed sends nothing. `column_order` lists every hideable column's key in
  the menu's order when it closes. With no `save_url:` it sends nothing. The app must provide that endpoint and persist
  both lists. The endpoint must answer with a success status when it has saved
  them. When it answers with an error status, or the request cannot reach the
  server, the menu does not reload the page: it shows "Your column changes were
  not saved." under the Columns button, and puts its boxes and its order back
  to what the table shows. The picker does not reorder the table: beside a table without
  `key:`, the app must pass the table and the picker its columns in the saved
  order itself. A table
  given `key:` renders its own Columns menu when the supplier gives a save
  address, so never add `ui_column_picker` beside such a table.

### Content and status

- `ui_button(label:, href: nil, variant: :primary, size: :md, type: :submit, data: nil)`
  — renders an `<a>` when `href:` is given and a `<button>` otherwise. `variant:`
  `:primary` `:secondary` `:danger`; `size:` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`; `type:` applies
  only to the button form.
- `ui_badge(label:, variant: :neutral, class: nil)` — a pill. `variant:`
  `:neutral` `:success` `:danger` `:warning` `:info`.
- `ui_figure(text:, tone: :neutral)` — no block. One figure, such as an amount,
  as inline text with no pill or box around it. `tone:` `:neutral` prints it in
  the surrounding text colour, `:success` in green and `:danger` in red; any
  other symbol raises `KeyError`. `text:` is printed as given, so format
  numbers, currency and any minus sign before passing it. Its output can be
  passed anywhere a string is shown, such as a `ui_data_table` cell value or
  column label.
- `ui_alert(message:, type: :info, title: nil, dismissible: false, class: nil)` —
  a banner.
  `type:` `:info` `:success` `:warning` `:error`. `dismissible: true` adds a
  close control.
- `ui_progress(value:, max:, label: nil)` — a labeled progress bar. The percent
  is `value / max`, rounded and clamped at 100.
- `ui_stat_card(label:, value:, variant: :neutral, suffix: nil, definition: nil, calculation: nil, change: nil, href: nil)`
  — a single metric tile. `variant:` `:neutral` `:success` `:danger` `:warning`
  `:info` colors the value. `change:` is a signed number rendered as `▲ 4.2%` in
  green when positive, `▼` in red when negative, plain when zero. `href:` makes
  the value a link to its drill-down screen; only the value is linked, never the
  whole card. Passing `definition:` and/or `calculation:` adds an info button
  whose details show in a panel floating below the card while the button is
  hovered or focused, and tapping the button toggles it.
- `ui_copy_button(text:, label: "Copy", success_message: "Copied!", error_message: "Failed!")`
  — copies `text:` to the clipboard.
- `ui_code(language: nil, caption: nil)` — takes a block holding the code. The
  caption is a header strip above the block; `language:` sets the `language-*`
  class for a highlighter.
- `ui_disclosure(open: false)` — takes a block yielding the component. Fill its
  `summary` slot with the clickable header; the rest of the block is the body.
  Native `<details>` — no JavaScript.
- `ui_calculation(groups:, summary: "How this is worked out")` — no block. Shows
  how a figure was reached, closed by default under a row reading `summary:`.
  `groups:` is `[{ title:, lines: [{ label:, working:, result: }, ...] }, ...]`;
  `title:` is optional, `lines:` is required and a group without it raises
  `KeyError`, and a line with any key other than those three raises
  `ArgumentError`. Each line renders as three columns — label, working, result
  — with the result right-aligned. Every value is printed as given, so format
  numbers and currency before passing them. Place it directly under the figure
  it explains, such as a `ui_stat_card`.
- `ui_info(summary:)` — an info button, named "More about this" for screen
  readers, placed inline beside the thing it explains, and sits level with the
  middle of the text beside it. `summary:` is a short
  line of text shown in a floating panel while the button is hovered. The block
  is optional and holds the full detail. With a block, tapping or clicking the
  button toggles a second floating panel holding the block's content, and the
  summary stays hover-only. With no block, tapping the button toggles the
  summary itself. A second tap closes what the first opened, a click anywhere
  else on the page closes the detail panel, and scrolling the page closes both
  panels. Each panel opens just under the button with its right edge on the
  button's right edge, the first time it opens as well as every later time,
  and stays at least 8 pixels from the left edge of the screen. The detail
  panel is wider than the summary panel, and the text in both wraps, so pass
  plain sentences and add no line breaks or widths of your own. The panels are
  placed against the screen, so the button can sit
  inside a table or any other container that clips its contents without the
  panels being cut off. Both panels render inside a `<span>`, so the block may
  hold text and inline elements only, such as a `ui_breakdown`, and never a
  `<div>`, list or table. Hovering and tapping both need the gem's Stimulus
  controllers registered, and without them the button shows nothing.
- `ui_breakdown(lines:, total:)` — no block. A list of amounts ending in their
  total. `lines:` is `[{ amount:, label: }, ...]` and `total:` is one
  `{ amount:, label: }`, both required. Each line renders its amount with its
  label beside it, and the total renders last, set apart from the lines above
  it. Every value is printed as given and nothing is added up, so compute the
  total and format numbers and currency before passing them. How the amounts
  and labels line up, and how the total is set apart, come from the
  `ks-breakdown` classes in the keystone_ui-styles gem, and the helper sets no
  widths or spacing of its own. It renders inline elements only, so it can sit
  inside a `ui_info` block.
- `ui_accordion(items: [])` — a stack of independently expandable rows. `items:`
  is `[{ question:, answer: }, ...]`.
- `ui_tab_switcher(tabs:)` — takes a block. `tabs:` is an array of label strings;
  the first is active on load. The block renders below the tab bar. Selecting a
  tab dispatches a `tab-switcher:change` event carrying the clicked index —
  showing and hiding the matching panels is the app's job.
- `ui_modal(title:, size: :md)` — takes a block holding the body. `size:` `:sm`
  `:md` `:lg` `:xl`. Renders hidden, and closes on its own close button and on a
  backdrop click. Nothing in the gem opens it: the modal's outermost element
  carries the `hidden` class, and the app's own code must remove that class to
  show it. A `data-action="modal#open"` placed outside the modal does nothing.
- `ui_swipe_deck(items:, empty_title: "All done!", empty_subtitle: nil)` — takes
  a block yielding the deck. Call `deck.item { |item| ... }` in the block to
  render one card's face. Accepting a card (button or swipe right) dispatches a
  bubbling `swipe-deck:complete` event and rejecting (button or swipe left)
  dispatches `swipe-deck:skip`. Both carry `detail.itemId` — the item's `id`, or
  its position in `items:` when it has none — and `detail.card`; `complete` also
  carries `detail.value`, read from an input inside the card's face marked
  `data-swipe-deck-value`, or `null`. The app must listen and persist the
  outcome.

### Charts and analytics

- `ui_chart_card(title:, height: :md)` — takes a block holding a chart. `height:`
  `:sm` `:md` `:lg`.
- `ui_line_chart(series:, labels: nil, dates: nil, height: :md)` — a line chart
  with one line per series. `series:` is
  `[{ name:, data:, color:, dashed: }, ...]` where `data:` is the array of
  values, and `color:` (a CSS color string for the line) and `dashed: true` are
  optional. `height:` `:sm` `:md` `:lg`. Pass exactly one of `labels:` and
  `dates:` for the horizontal axis: passing both, or neither, raises
  `ArgumentError`. `labels:` is an array of strings, one per value, spaced
  evenly and shown as written. `dates:` is an array of `Date`, `Time` or
  `DateTime` values, one per value, matched to each series' `data:` by
  position. A dated chart places each point by its day, so a gap of a week is
  seven times as wide as a gap of a day. Its axis runs from the first day to
  the last, marks only whole days, and reads each day as a date such as
  "Oct 2, 2026", which is also the heading a hovered point shows. The time of
  day is dropped, so pass one value per day.
- `ui_funnel(steps:, shape: :bars)` — a conversion funnel. `steps:` is
  `[{ label:, value:, color: }, ...]` in order, with `color:` optional. Each
  step's width is its value as a share of the first step's value, and the
  percent shown between two steps is the second step's value divided by the
  first's. Each step takes the next colour in the order `:accent` `:sky`
  `:violet` `:amber` `:rose`, starting again after `:rose`; a step passing one
  of those symbols as `color:` uses it instead, and any other symbol raises.
  Values are printed as given. Divide-by-zero safe, no JavaScript. `shape:`
  `:bars` draws one bar per step, left-aligned, with the label and value on a
  row above it and a `↓ N%` caption between two bars. `shape: :joined` draws
  one shape: each step's value over its label in a column on the left, each
  step's block centred at its width, and between two blocks a neutral band
  that narrows from the block above to the block below, with the percent on it.
  Any other `shape:` raises `ArgumentError`.
- `ui_bucket(goal:, actual:, label: nil, over: :success)` — an upright container
  for one target, filled from the bottom toward `goal:`. It shows the optional
  `label` on top, then `goal`, the container, `actual`, and the percent reached.
  `goal` and `actual` must be numbers: a string such as `"9,000"`, or `nil`,
  raises `ArgumentError` at render time. They are printed as Ruby prints them,
  with no thousands separators, so `9000` shows as `9000` and `9000.0` as
  `9000.0`. A value read from a decimal column is a `BigDecimal`, which prints
  as `0.9e4`, so convert it with `to_i` or `to_f` first. The percent is
  `actual / goal * 100` rounded and **not**
  clamped (so 150% shows as 150%), and it is 0 when `goal` is zero. The fill
  stops at the top once the goal is reached. Within the goal the fill uses the
  accent colour; over it the fill turns green with `over: :success` or amber with
  `over: :warning`, and any other symbol raises. No JavaScript.
- `ui_bucket_series(buckets:)` — a row of buckets that wraps onto more rows on
  narrow screens. `buckets:` is an array of hashes, each taking the same keywords
  as `ui_bucket`, e.g. `[{ goal: 10, actual: 7, label: "Mon" }, ...]`.
- `ui_pipeline(title:, boxes:, links:, subtitle: nil)` — a staged flow diagram
  for event flows, approval chains, or state machines. `boxes:` is
  `[{ label:, count:, accent:, action: }, ...]` where `count:` and `accent:`
  (`:amber` `:emerald` `:danger` `:muted`) are optional, and `action:` is
  `{ url:, label:, params:, variant: }` rendering a button that POSTs `params`
  to `url`. `links:` has exactly one fewer entry than `boxes:`, each
  `{ url:, params:, broken: }`, rendering a ✓/✗ toggle between two boxes that
  POSTs to flip its state. The app owns every endpoint these post to.

### Marketing sections

- `ui_hero(title:, subtitle: nil, badge: nil, layout: :split)` — takes a block
  holding the call-to-action buttons, and yields the component so its `aside`
  slot can hold an image or panel. `layout:` `:split` (content beside the aside)
  or `:centered`.
- `ui_cta_banner(title:, subtitle: nil)` — takes a block holding the
  call-to-action buttons.
- `ui_feature_grid(title:, features:, subtitle: nil)` — a responsive grid of
  feature cards. `features:` is `[{ icon:, title:, description: }, ...]` where
  `icon:` is a raw SVG or HTML string.

## How to use it

1. Confirm the helpers are available in the app. If they are not, stop and hand
   off to `keystone_ui-install` — do not hand-roll the markup in the meantime.

2. Find the closest existing screen in `app/views/` and read it. Match its
   composition before inventing one; that screen is the house style.

3. Pick the page shell for what you are building:
   - a form screen → `ui_form_page`, then `ui_page` holding the form
   - a detail screen → `ui_show_page`, then `ui_page` holding `ui_page_header`
     and the details
   - anything else → `ui_page`, with `ui_page_header` for the desktop title.

   ```erb
   <%= ui_form_page(title: "New quote", back_url: quotes_path) %>
   <%= ui_page(max_width: :md) do %>
     <%= ui_form(action: quotes_path) do %>
       ...
     <% end %>
   <% end %>
   ```

   The shell call always comes first and sits outside `ui_page`'s block,
   because `ui_page` renders what the shell handed it at its own top. A form or
   detail screen without `ui_page` shows no desktop "Back" link or form title.
   Those shells supply the desktop "Back" link themselves, so never add a
   second back link or button to those screens. Whether a screen
   shows breadcrumbs under its "Back" link, and which parent screens the trail
   names, is the developer's choice, so ask before passing `trail:`. A screen
   a navigation tab opens directly, such as a bottom tab's own page, passes
   `trail: []` and no `back_url:`, so it shows no "Back" link and no back
   arrow; which screens those are is the developer's choice, so ask. Check
   first whether the app's Keystone UI initializer sets a `trail_supplier`,
   which supplies a trail for every request: if it
   does, a screen whose supplied trail is right passes neither `trail:` nor
   `back_url:`, and passes its own only where the supplied one is wrong. If the
   app supplies no trail, every form and detail screen passes `back_url:` or
   `trail:`, since a screen with neither raises `KeystoneUi::MissingBackLink`
   when it renders. Every link in a trail needs both a label and an `href`, or
   the screen raises `KeystoneUi::IncompleteTrail`. Setting up a supplied trail is `keystone_ui-install`'s job. Below `lg:` the
   back link comes from `ui_mobile_header`, which the navbar renders from the
   title and back URL these shells publish. Check the app's layout: if it does not
   already render `ui_mobile_header` from that published context, ask the
   developer whether to wire it before adding more screens that depend on it.

4. Lay out the body with `ui_section` for each titled group, `ui_grid` for
   multi-column arrangements, and `ui_panel` or `ui_card_link` for card
   surfaces. Nest them; each takes a block.

5. Fill the body with the leaf helpers from the Interface above. Reach for the
   most specific one that fits — `ui_form_field` over `ui_input`,
   `ui_data_table` over a hand-built `<table>`, `ui_stat_card` over a panel with
   text in it. To make a stat card clickable, pass `href:` — never wrap it in
   `ui_card_link`, because a tap on the info button would then follow the link.
   To show the arithmetic behind a figure, put `ui_calculation` under it rather
   than a hand-built list. Which lines and groups to show is the app's own
   calculation, so ask the developer which steps a reader needs to see.
   To explain a figure or label that is not a stat card, put `ui_info` beside
   it, with the one-line explanation as `summary:` and, when the figure is a
   sum of parts, a `ui_breakdown` in its block. Which amounts the breakdown
   lists, and the wording of the summary, are the app's own, so ask the
   developer rather than pick. If an info button shows nothing when hovered or
   tapped, the gem's Stimulus controllers are not registered, so stop and hand
   that part to `keystone_ui-install`. If a breakdown renders as one run of
   text with no columns and no separate total, the app's keystone_ui-styles
   version does not define the `ks-breakdown` classes, so stop and hand that
   part to `keystone_ui-install` as well, and add no classes to fix it.
   To show an amount as a gain or a loss, use `ui_figure` with `tone:` rather
   than a `ui_badge` or a colour class. Which amounts are coloured, and whether
   a value counts as a gain or a loss, is the app's own rule, so ask the
   developer rather than pick. If a figure with `:success` or `:danger` shows in
   the plain text colour, the app's keystone_ui-styles version does not define
   the `ks-figure` and `ks-tone-*` classes, so stop and hand that part to
   `keystone_ui-install`, and add no classes to fix it.
   A field whose value must be one of a fixed list is a `:select` with
   `options:`, and a field that accepts any text and offers common values is a
   text field with `suggestions:`. Which one a field is, and which values it
   suggests, is the app's own rule, so ask the developer rather than pick.
   On a radio card or a checkbox row, text every reader needs to choose goes in `hint:` and
   text only some will want goes in `info:`. Which is which is the app's own
   wording, so ask the developer rather than pick.
   For a line chart, pass `dates:` when each value belongs to a calendar day
   and `labels:` when the horizontal axis is anything else, such as week names
   or categories. With `dates:`, a day with no value leaves a wider gap between
   its neighbours rather than a point at zero. Whether a missing day is left
   out or passed as a zero is the app's own rule, so ask the developer rather
   than pick. Never format dates into strings and pass them as `labels:`.
   For a funnel, whether it is drawn as separate bars or as one joined shape
   is the developer's choice, so ask before passing `shape:`. If a joined
   funnel shows its blocks but no band between them, the app's
   keystone_ui-styles version does not define the `ks-funnel-band` classes, so
   stop and hand that part to `keystone_ui-install`, and add no classes to fix
   it.
   Put the actions on a record, such as Edit and Delete, in an action menu
   rather than in a row of buttons: `menu:` on the `ui_section` that shows the
   record, `table.actions` for a table row, or `ui_action_menu` anywhere else.
   A delete item asks for confirmation on its own, so pass `confirm:` only
   when the developer wants different wording. A `:post`, `:patch` or `:put`
   item sends without asking, so ask the developer whether that action needs
   a question, and pass it as `confirm:` if it does.

6. For a table, decide how columns are declared. Use `{ key: "Label" }` hashes
   when every column is plain. Switch the whole set to `Keystone::Ui::Column`
   objects as soon as one column needs `mobile_hidden:`, `sortable:`,
   `hideable:`, or `locked:`.

   To keep a wide table's first column, such as a name, in view while the rest
   scrolls sideways, declare it first with `locked: true`. Whether a table locks
   its first column is the developer's choice, so ask rather than pick. If the
   locked column stays in place but the scrolled columns show through its
   cells, the app's keystone_ui-styles version does not define the
   `ks-table-header-locked` and `ks-table-cell-locked` classes, so stop and hand
   that part to `keystone_ui-install`, and add no classes to fix it.

   For a table whose hideable columns a user should be able to choose and keep,
   check whether the app's Keystone UI initializer sets a
   `preference_supplier`. If it does, pass `key:` and the default
   `hidden_columns:`, and add no `ui_column_picker`. The order the columns are
   declared in is the default order, and only columns declared
   `hideable: true` can be hidden or moved from the Columns menu. Which key
   names the table, which columns are hideable, and which it hides by default
   are the developer's choice, so ask rather than pick. If the app sets no supplier, either use `ui_column_picker`
   with an endpoint the app owns, as in step 7, or hand setting up a supplier to
   `keystone_ui-install`, and ask the developer which. If a Columns menu shows
   no greyed name for a hidden column, the app's keystone_ui-styles version is
   older than 0.11.0, so stop and hand that part to `keystone_ui-install`, and
   add no classes to fix it.

7. Wire up anything that posts back. Several helpers render controls whose
   endpoints the app must own — the column picker's save URL, the pipeline's box
   and link URLs, the swipe deck's outcome events, the modal's open trigger, the
   tab switcher's panel visibility. Each is named in the Interface. These are
   real decisions about the app's domain: where a preference is persisted, what
   a stage's action does, what happens when a card is accepted. Do not invent
   routes or a persistence strategy — put the choice to the developer, then
   implement what they pick.

8. To let users pick light or dark, place `ui_theme_toggle`. Where it goes — a
   settings screen, the navbar's `desktop_right` or a mobile menu — is the
   developer's choice, so ask before placing it. It only stays correct across
   page loads and Turbo visits when the app's layout already writes the theme
   onto its `html` tag and the gem's Stimulus controllers are registered. If the
   layout's `<html` tag carries nothing for the theme, stop and hand that part to
   `keystone_ui-install`.

9. Read back what you wrote and delete every Tailwind class and inline `style`
   you added. If the result still needs one, that is a signal the wrong helper
   was chosen — go back to step 5. Bring it to the developer only if no helper
   fits.

## Conventions

- **Helpers only.** Call `ui_*` helpers from ERB. Never name a component class
  directly in an app. `Keystone::Ui::Column` is the one exception — it is a value
  object passed as an argument, not a thing that renders.
- **Never hand-write Tailwind for something a helper covers.** Utility classes
  layered onto a helper's output fight the component and drift the moment the gem
  updates. The gem owns spacing, color, borders, radius, shadow, and dark mode.
- **Never restyle a helper from the outside** — no wrapper div that overrides its
  padding or width, no CSS targeting its markup. Choose a different option
  symbol instead, or say the helper does not fit.
- **`class:` needs the developer's approval.** The six helpers that accept it
  append whatever it holds to their outer element, so it can override anything
  the gem sets. Before passing it, name the class and the reason to the
  developer and wait for a yes; if the same class keeps being needed, it is a
  missing option in the gem.
- **Semantic color only.** Themed color is `accent-*` (the brand hue) and
  `surface-*` (the neutral family). Never write a literal color into a view;
  changing the palette is install-local territory.
- **Options are per-helper.** `variant:`, `size:`, `padding:`, and `spacing:` do
  not share one vocabulary — a button's `variant:` and a badge's `variant:`
  accept different symbols. Use the values listed above; a wrong symbol raises at
  render time rather than degrading quietly.
- **Containers take blocks, leaves take keywords.** Helpers that wrap content
  yield; helpers that render one thing are configured entirely by keywords.
  Composite helpers (the navbar, the hero, the disclosure) yield the component so
  named slots can be filled. Helpers that yield a receiver for registration —
  the data table, page header, and swipe deck — only render what was registered
  through it, so anything else emitted inside their block is discarded.
- **Mobile is not an afterthought.** Several helpers render only on one side of
  the `lg:` (or `sm:`) breakpoint — page headers, mobile headers, mobile actions,
  bottom navigation, breadcrumbs. The action menu is the exception and shows at
  every size. A screen needs both treatments; check the small viewport
  before calling it done.
- Out of scope for this local: installing or upgrading the gem, changing the
  palette or theme defaults, and editing the components themselves. Building a
  new UI primitive belongs in the gem, not in a host app's views — raise it with
  the developer rather than approximating it locally.
